    "\n",
    "The iron core of our planet conducts electricity, which creates a magnetic field around Earth. This magnetic field not only provides a protective shield against sunâ€™s unwanted rays, but also creates a kind of a map that remains relatively constant across time. Many animal species are thought to rely on this magnetic field for wayfinding, from migratory birds across the open skies to fish, reptiles and crustaceans in the deep ocean. For example, sea turtles can use the magnetic field to make plans between points A and B on the globe, and to orient themselves, i.e., to know where they are on the Earth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that the planet's magnetic field can be described using a grid. Each cell in this grid consists of the *intensity* and *direction* of the magnetic field at that cell. As one moves one step to the east, the intensity of the magnetic field increases by 0.05 (arbitrary units) and rotates \"counterclockwise\" (i.e., decreases without modulo operation) by 0.05 (arbitrary units). The reverse of this happens when one moves one step to the west. And as one moves one step to north, the intensity of the magnetic field decreases by 0.05 and rotates \"clockwise\" (i.e., increases without modulo) by 0.05. The reverse of this happens when one moves one step to the south.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to write Julia functions, called `magnetic_field_kernel`, that when it is called within another function called `magnetic_field` with the magnetic field information of an initial coordinate (including the intensity and direction at this coordinate) and a sequence of moves (i.e., a sequence of \"north\"s, \"south\"s, \"east\"s and \"west\"s), generates a trajectory of intensities and directions. (You will also write a function to visualize these trajectories; see below.) Implement a Julia `struct` to represent and modify the magnetic field information at a cell; the struct should include the following four entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `x`: current coordinate in the east-west axis\n",
    "- `y`: current coordinate in the north-south axis\n",

    "\n",
    "And implement the following transitions in your `magnetic_field_kernel` function as to how they modify the state:\n",
    "\n",
    "- north (`n`): move one coordinate north\\\n",
